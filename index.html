                <p>
                    Hello! My name is Sarah and I originally grew up in the tiny mountain town of NC. 
                    <br>
                    In my early childhood my passions included reading, sewing, photography and dog agility 
                    training with my Dog Cali. My continued reading as a child grew and developed into a desire 
                    to travel and see the places I had only see through the pages of my books. 
                    Through a love of art and photography I went on to study entertainment technology so that I 
                    could be a part of bringing these stories to life.
                    <br> 
                    Since my graduation, I have traveled to 17+ different countries for work, and have worked with 
                    individuals from all walks of life and cultural backgrounds. My love helping artists achieve 
                    their vision through programming of entertainment technology (concert tour lights, automation etc.) 
                    introduced me to an entirely different world of coding.
                    <br> 
                    Over the years I have developed an increasing interest in immersive and interactive art as an educational 
                    and business engagement tool. The types of projects I now desire to work on require more than just a base 
                    knowledge of coding and computers, as I would like to create interactive applications which help further 
                    business engagement as well as make education/training more engaging and immersive.
